Hello! I am a Master student at the Korea University, advised by Prof. Jinkyu Kim. I am currently collaborating closely with closely with Prof. Kimin Lee at KAIST. Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the Lee Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of Professor Kangwook Lee.

My long-term research goal is to develop capable and robust AI agents. To achieve this, my current research focuses on advancing generative foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, I have focused on exploring the property of generative modeling (e.g., next-token prediction) and developing effective post-training methods (e.g., RL fine-tuning).

You can find my curriculum vitae here.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
