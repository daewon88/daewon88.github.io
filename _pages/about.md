Hello! I am a Master student in Computer Science at Korea University, advised by [Prof. Jinkyu Kim](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/). I am currently collaborating closely with [Prof. Kimin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/kiminlee) at KAIST. Previously, I was a visiting student at the Lee Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of [Prof. Kangwook Lee](https://kangwooklee.com/aboutme/).

My long-term research goal is to develop capable and robust AI agents. To achieve this, my current research focuses on advancing generative foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, I have focused on exploring the property of generative modeling (e.g., next-token prediction) and developing effective post-training methods (e.g., RL fine-tuning).
